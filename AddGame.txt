Problem Statement for AddGame


Problem Statement
    	
Your friend Lucas gave you a sequence S of positive integers.



For a while, you two played a simple game with S: Lucas would pick a number, and you had to select some elements of S such that the sum of all numbers you selected is the number chosen by Lucas. For example, if S={2,1,2,7} and Lucas chose the number 11, you would answer that 2+2+7 = 11.



Lucas now wants to trick you by choosing a number X such that there will be no valid answer. For example, if S={2,1,2,7}, it is not possible to select elements of S that sum up to 6.



You are given the int[] S. Find the smallest positive integer X that cannot be obtained as the sum of some (possibly all) elements of S.

Examples
0)	
    	
{5, 1, 2}
Returns: 4
These are all the positive integers that can be obtained: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. (We can obtain 3 as 1+2, 6 as 1+5, 7 as 2+5, and 8 as 1+2+5.) The smallest positive integer not present in the above list is 4.
1)	
    	
{2, 1, 4}
Returns: 8
We can obtain each of the sums from 1 to 7, inclusive. The smallest impossible sum is 8.
2)	
    	
{2, 1, 2, 7}
Returns: 6
The example given in the problem statement.
